It's always bothered me that orcs don't always wear Orcish Armor. I know this is done for balance because Orcish Armor is a pretty good armor set, but it was still a niggle I always had regardless. Originally I planned to just say "screw it" and distribute Orcish out proper NPCs, but the prospect of getting Orcish Armor early held me back. So I came to a compromise: I would use some of NordWarUA's brilliant alternate Orcish sets to create a light version of Orcish that was equivalent to leather. This allowed me to improve the aesthetic of Stronghold Orcs without sacrificing balance.

Similarly, I've always loved CaBal's dark texture for Elven Armor that is available in Book of Silence, however I didn't really want the Thalmor coloring to take over all of the Elven Armor in the game. So I separated them out, Thalmor now wear "Thalmor Armor" which uses CaBal's dark textures and normal Elven Armor is completely unchanged. While I was at it I also did a similar thing for Glass Armor. The Thalmor now have a consistently dark aesthetic without editing the vanilla armor.
